Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me nuggets near and far. Enjoy my tasty nuggly treats, in comfy big boy booster seats. McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's, But of my nuggets none remains. She tries to make me take a nappy, But sleeping doesn't make me happy. Nuggies are the only food, That puts me in the napping mood. I'll scream and shout and make a fuss, I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Nuggets are my heart's desire, Fueled by raging, hungry fire. Mummy sobs and wails and cries, But tears aren't nugs, tendies or fries. My good-boy points were fairly earned, To buy the nuggets that I've yearned. But there's no nuggets on my plate! Did mummy think that I'd just ate? NUGGETS NUGGETS GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW! I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise. For she who is un-pooped on is she who shan't be smug: Never forget my chicken nugs.",

I feel like I should just leave because clearly nobody wants to be around me and everyone would be happier if i left anyways so i’ll just go and i hope all of you find happiness in life and i’m sorry for all the troubles i’ve ever put any of you through. i give up. goodbye.",

Too bad there's a fucking wall where your feet go. Need anti-ice in a descent? That fucking sucks, the thing only has enough power to get the anti-ice to come on at goddamn 75% thrust. Descending with power in and spoilers out. Fucking brilliant. Put blowers in the thing so maybe everyone won't die when you shut the packs off to start an engine in PHX in July? Naw, fuck that. Don't worry though, once the engine starts are complete, the cabin will cool down. Around the time you get to FL330, which will take around 2 hours because you had to level off at 230,250,270,290 and 310 to take a running start at the next altitude. And that's if you were one of the lucky bastards that actually had a working APU, even though that pile of shit didn't do half of anything anyway. You'd see people with their fucking lips on the gaspers trying to suck out whatever fresh air they could because the APU puts out air like an asthmatic breathing through a straw. Also, thanks, bumble-fucks at bombardier for not giving the thing slats. I just love 170kt GS approaches into Denver in the summer. Good fucking thing there's 12000' of runway, because once I flare from this stupid lawn dart 5 degree down approach angle, there's a pretty good chance I'm floating forever. Sure hope there isn't too much of a crosswind. Nothing says stability like main wheels that are 6 feet apart from each other. Taking off is a grand old time too. Flaps 8? Have fun with your 147kt vr speed in a plane you have to start flying at 50kts or the wind will pick up a wing and you'll wing strike the downwind wing that's only 3 feet off the ground anyway. God I hate that thing.",

There has been no particular reason for this, perhaps burnout, perhaps I have beaten the game with a 1650 character. Again, there is no big reason for my absence. Just think about the good times that I did 78% damage in that Kayangel run, or the time I used my personal balthor to shield everyone. Again, no reason for the departure. I may return one day however, maybe on a newer account to revisit the game and play as a mokoko again. who knows, but for now, goodbye Heroes of Arkesia!",

Hundreds of tables! It's possible I looked at over a thousand tables, I honestly don't know. The specific number isn't as important as the understanding that of all the tables that I looked at, this one is the most serious. I relate this story to impress upon you, the extent to which this is the most serious room I have, which is why I brought you here. You just tried to activate server cheats, which, of course, runs the risk of breaking the entire game. You've got no respect for the strict order of scripted narrative events and I just can't have that. It's time to get serious, Stanley. No jokes, no games. Outside of this room, I might be more tolerant of those things, but now we're in the room. Which is why I'm subjecting you to the most serious punishment I can think of: one hundred million-billion-trillion years, standing here in the serious room. Perhaps after that, we can talk about the severity of your actions, and whether you've learned anything. But, until then, serious room, GO.",
