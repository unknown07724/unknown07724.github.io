Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me nuggets near and far. Enjoy my tasty nuggly treats, in comfy big boy booster seats. McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's, But of my nuggets none remains. She tries to make me take a nappy, But sleeping doesn't make me happy. Nuggies are the only food, That puts me in the napping mood. I'll scream and shout and make a fuss, I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Nuggets are my heart's desire, Fueled by raging, hungry fire. Mummy sobs and wails and cries, But tears aren't nugs, tendies or fries. My good-boy points were fairly earned, To buy the nuggets that I've yearned. But there's no nuggets on my plate! Did mummy think that I'd just ate? NUGGETS NUGGETS GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW! I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise. For she who is un-pooped on is she who shan't be smug: Never forget my chicken nugs.",

    "text": "Imagine being Arnold in that scene and having to be all like damn, Jamie Curtis, you fuckin' fine, all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face. I would totally have sex with you, both my character and the real me. when all he really wants to do is fuck another 16 year old in his dressing room. Like seriously imagine having to be Arnold and not only sit in that chair while Jamie Lee Curtis flaunts her disgusting body in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while she perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her she's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, JAMIE LEE CURTIS LOOKS LIKE THAT?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Austria. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her statuesque (for that is what she calls herself) beauty, the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then the director calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Arnold. You're not going to lose your future political career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.",

I feel like I should just leave because clearly nobody wants to be around me and everyone would be happier if i left anyways so i’ll just go and i hope all of you find happiness in life and i’m sorry for all the troubles i’ve ever put any of you through. i give up. goodbye.",

There has been no particular reason for this, perhaps burnout, perhaps I have beaten the game with a 1650 character. Again, there is no big reason for my absence. Just think about the good times that I did 78% damage in that Kayangel run, or the time I used my personal balthor to shield everyone. Again, no reason for the departure. I may return one day however, maybe on a newer account to revisit the game and play as a mokoko again. who knows, but for now, goodbye Heroes of Arkesia!",

Tall points, no quills, no pillows, look at that, it looks like two balls and a bong. He fucked my wife, so guess what, I'm gonna fuck the earth. That's right, this is what you get!

Hundreds of tables! It's possible I looked at over a thousand tables, I honestly don't know. The specific number isn't as important as the understanding that of all the tables that I looked at, this one is the most serious. I relate this story to impress upon you, the extent to which this is the most serious room I have, which is why I brought you here. You just tried to activate server cheats, which, of course, runs the risk of breaking the entire game. You've got no respect for the strict order of scripted narrative events and I just can't have that. It's time to get serious, Stanley. No jokes, no games. Outside of this room, I might be more tolerant of those things, but now we're in the room. Which is why I'm subjecting you to the most serious punishment I can think of: one hundred million-billion-trillion years, standing here in the serious room. Perhaps after that, we can talk about the severity of your actions, and whether you've learned anything. But, until then, serious room, GO.",
