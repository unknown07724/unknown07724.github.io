if you want to contribute to our stuff, first "fork" or in other words press that button near the top of the website and then do your edits, you must add atleast one project or good change to the site and
after that you do a "pull request" or in other words ask to merge your fork with the official site, if it meets our standards, we will accept, if not we will reject it, allow others to help with your pull request,
if it is a bug you can not fix yourself, you should post an issue and we will track it down as best as possible
# what is a good change?
a good change is something like decluttering a feature like the project's list or the biographies
